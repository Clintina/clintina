## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
# Hi, I'm clintina ğŸ‘‹
But..call me Tina. I am an aspiring Back-End software developer. I have recently transitioned from the customer service industry to the tech field and I am super excited and ready to take on this challenge. I want to build things that have a meaningful impact on people. I want to help change the world.

## ğŸš€ About Me
I am currently enrolled into the ALX Back-End development program and I hope to only gain more knowledge and improve my skills. 

I enjoy being outdoors, reading and getting to know people. I love animals, I have a dog, his name is Anonymous and one cat, her name is Nina.
